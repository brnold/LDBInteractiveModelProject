##What's where?

###Software
This is the actual software running on the Beaglebone black at startup.

###Turning Scripts
Used during the assembly process. It's a slightly older, less refined version of the software. It's purposes is to print out the requested capacitor touch sensor IC electrode values on the terminal screen.

###Auto Copy Bash Script
This script was written so the users could load new scripts into the model at a later date. This script has a ? hook associated with it in the Linux OS. The 3 sound files are for audible feedback.

###Arduino_MRP_121_Code
Code developed during the development cycle for prototyping purposes. Deprecated.
